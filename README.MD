## Projects

<!-- PROJECTS_LIST_START -->
- [Birthday Problem Simulation](./Birthday Problem Simulation/) - This project is a Python simulation of the famous Birthday Problem. It demonstrates the surprisingly high probability of two people sharing a birthday in a relatively small group.
- [Happy Numbers](./Happy Numbers/) - A Python implementation to determine whether a number is a "happy number" or not.
- [Monty Hall Problem Simulation](./Monty Hall Problem Simulation/) - This project is a Python simulation of the famous Monty Hall problem. It demonstrates the counter-intuitive probabilities involved in the game.
- [Number Guesser](./Number Guesser/) - This solution provides a modular approach to the Number Guesser Game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user is prompted to guess this number. For each incorrect guess, the user receives a hint and their score is reduced.
- [Password Generator](./Password Generator/) - This project is a Python script for generating various types of passwords. It provides a flexible framework for creating PINs, complex random passwords, and memorable passphrases.
- [Password Generator - GUI](./Password Generator - GUI/) - This small Python project provides a set of password generators and a minimal GUI wrapper. It includes utilities to create numeric PINs, random-character passwords (with options for numbers and symbols), and memorable passphrase-style passwords built from an English word list.
- [Rock-Paper-Scissors](./Rock-Paper-Scissors/) - No description available.
